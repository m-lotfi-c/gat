The GNOME Task Scheduler (Gnome At)
  by Patrick Reynolds

Gat allows you to schedule tasks that will run once or periodically.  It
is a front-end to cron and at, though in theory, you should be able to use
Gat with little or no knowledge of cron or at.  Gat can list, add, remove,
and test cron and at jobs.

To build Gat:
  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  make install       # as root

Requirements:
  GTK 2.x
  GNOME 2.x

To run Gat:
  gat
